===================================================

This repository contains logo files used by the SBML project.

The longer explanation in the section below titled "Policy for using the logos" essentially states the following: the "Supports SBML" logo (shown upper right above) may be used freely to indicate support of SBML, but its use carries _no implication about the degree of compliance_ with the SBML specifications and does not indicate endorsement by anyone associated with the SBML effort.
