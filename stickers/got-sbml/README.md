The "got SBML?" sticker, circa 2009
===================================

Around 2009, Mike Hucka and the SBML Team arranged to have stickers produced for promotional purposes.  We worked with [VGKids](https://www.vgkids.com) to produce the stickers; at the time, they were one of the least expensive and best options. (Sadly, they no longer offer sticker printing as a service.)  We were very pleased with the results and the work by VGKids.  The files in this directory are the source files sent to the printer.
