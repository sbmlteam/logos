The "SB" sticker of 2019
========================

In 2019, Mike Hucka arranged to have a simple "SB" sticker printed for promotional purposes.  The printer was [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com), and we were very happy with the final results.  The stickers were 2"&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2" in size and work nicely for decorating such things as the backs of laptops.  The files in this directory are the source files sent to the printer.
