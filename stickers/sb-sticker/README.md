The "SB" sticker of 2019
========================

In 2019, Mike Hucka arranged to have a simple "SB" sticker printed for promotional purposes.  The printer was [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com), and we were very happy with the final results.  The stickers were 2"&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2" in size and work nicely for decorating such things as the backs of laptops.  The files in this directory are the source files sent to the printer.

Note that the "SB" logo was created by Hiroshige Fukurama for the ERATO Kitano Symbiotic Systems Project.  The "SB" logo is a trademarked design ([registration number 3233845 in the US Patent and Trademark Office](http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4802:xey3hy.5.30)).  The SBML project has permission to freely use the "SB" logo for purposes of promoting SBML.
