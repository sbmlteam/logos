The SBML t-shirt of 2010
========================

In 2010, the SBML Team arranged to have t-shirts produced for promotional purposes.  We worked with [VGKids](https://www.vgkids.com) to produce the shirts.  We were very pleased with the results and the work by VGKids.  The files in this directory are the source files sent to the printer.
