The "SBML supported" logo
=========================

The file [sbml-supported-badge.svg](sbml-supported-badge.svg) contains artwork for the official "SBML supported" logo.  This logo is intended to convey the concept that a given software system, website, network service, or other thing is compatible with or supports SBML in some fashion.  It is provided for software developers and other interested parties if they wish to use it to communicate this support or compatibility, but is important to note that _**use of the logo is voluntary and does not indicate degree of compliance, nor does it represent endorsement by anyone or any entity involved with the development of SBML**_.

History and concept
-------------------

After SBML rose in popularity in the early 2000's, there also arose interest in having a logo or badge that could be placed on websites, software installation screens, and other materials in order to communicate the fact that a software or service could work with SBML.  This led the SBML Team to consider having different logos to indicate different degrees of compliance with SBML: a basic "supports SBML" badge that had no other implications, and a "compliance-tested" badge that implied the software was verified to adhere correctly to SBML specifications.  The SBML Team created artwork for these different badges, but the goal of having a "compliance-tested" badge was met with challenges due to the lack of an independent method of testing any given software system.  The Team itself did not have the resources to do the testing, and there were no independent 3rd-party testing labs.  In the end, the "compliance-tested" logos were never introduced, and only the "supports SBML" badge was made public.  That is the logo found in this directory.

The original artwork was made in Adobe Illustrator.  The colors and proportions of the "ML" letters were slightly changed from the version of the "SBML" logo created by the original designer (an artist commissioned by Hiroaki Kitano in Japan).  The changes were made by Mike Hucka.

The original logo was made available around 2005 in a number of (small) pixel sizes in JPG and PNG formats.  This was done to optimize the appearance for smaller logo sizes (e.g., to counteract the smearing of thin lines by anti-aliasing algorithms.)  Today (in the year 2020), it no longer seems necessary to provide alternative formats because use of the scalable SVG format has become common, so only the logo is only provided in SVG format here.
